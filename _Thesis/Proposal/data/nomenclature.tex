\chapter*{NOMENCLATURE}
\addcontentsline{toc}{chapter}{NOMENCLATURE}  % Needs to be set to part, so the TOC doesnt add 'CHAPTER ' prefix in the TOC.

%A note about aligning: These entries will align
%themselves according to the ampersand (&).
%No extra spaces are needed, as seen in some of
%the entries below.

%Example of the longtable environment.
